                        Modern E/E systems are characterized by a huge growth in complexity. One of the biggest challenges is developing these complex, multi-domain systems in a coherent, integrated way, which is driving companies to evolve their E/E system development approaches to meet the market challenges of tomorrow. The next generation of development approaches must blur the boundaries between software, electrical, electronic, and network development to ensure comprehensive traceability and compliance whilst accelerating product development. To help companies thrive in this new world the Capital electrical/electronic (E/E) systems development software portfolio has been strategically expanded to support this. Building upon leading Capital capabilities for the design, manufacture, and service of electrical systems, the portfolio is now expanded to encompass E/E system and software architectures, network communications, and embedded software development.

        <!-- Capital delivers advanced automation across a flow extending from electrical/electronic architecture definition, through detailed electrical design and wire harness manufacturing, to documentation and diagnostics. Powerful functionality of particular importance to the electrical domain is available: examples include functional verification, manufacturing process generation, and configuration and design change management. Rich data modeling and data management are central to Capital, complementing the Model Based Enterprise philosophy. Designed for enterprise deployments, Capital is built to integrate with adjacent domains such as requirements capture, mechanical CAD, and manufacturing execution. IT needs for scalability, security features and modern computing environments are supported. Capital can be deployed into an Oracle RDBMS environment or with its own embedded database. Capital tools are in use globally by many of the world’s largest engineering companies. -->
