Powerful functionality of particular importance to the electrical domain is available: examples include functional verification, manufacturing process generation, and configuration and design change management. Rich data modeling and data management are central to Capital, complementing the Model Based Enterprise philosophy. Designed for enterprise deployments, Capital is built to integrate with adjacent domains such as requirements capture, mechanical CAD, and manufacturing execution. IT needs for scalability, security features and modern computing environments are supported. Capital can be deployed into an Oracle RDBMS environment or with its own embedded database. Capital tools are in use globally by many of the world’s largest engineering companies. -->
