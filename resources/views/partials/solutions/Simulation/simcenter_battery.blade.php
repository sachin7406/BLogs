                    <p>
                        Simcenter Battery Design Studio (BDS) supports engineers in digitally validating Li-ion cell design thanks to detailed geometrical cell specifications and cell performance simulation. Extensive components of a battery cell are available, as well as a material database to support your model development. Simcenter BDS offers several levels of performance models: a physics-based macro-homogeneous model to get insights into the cell’s electrochemical mechanisms; and an equivalent RCR circuit model, which is an empirical approach to modeling the cell’s behavior in a very computationally effective way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The additional understanding gained by using Simcenter BDS leads to an improved consideration of your design decisions and their impact on your system performances. Our solution supports you in making the optimized feasible choice.

                        <li>
                            Compute important attributes of a new cell designs, such as nominal capacity, open circuit voltage or total mass, using the electrode dimensions and electrochemistry parameters
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Understand the sensitivity of a defined cell to the manufacturing variability of underlying parameters, e.g. variable electrode porosity or active particle size
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Simulate the electrochemical response of a cell to a given load, whether power or current, and optimize a design to reduce the total mass or improve the capacity of the cell Understand and visualize the underlying phenomena that limit the rate capability or capacity of a cell design, which may be a limitation of the active material, electrolyte or current path
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create equivalent circuit models, which capture the response to load of a tested cell, by reading in test data and automatically regressing parameters to populate the circuit model
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally, complete a cell design which can then be passed to <a href="https://cae.ddsplm.com/CFD-simulations/Fluid-dynamics-analysis/Simcenter/Simcenter-StarCCM+.html">STAR-CCM+</a> to represent the cell in a detailed three-dimensional model. It can also be multiplied to create a module or pack
                        </li>
