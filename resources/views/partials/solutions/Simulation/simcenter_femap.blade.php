                        Simcenter Femap is an advanced simulation application for creating, editing, and inspecting finite element models of complex products or systems. You can use advanced workflows in Simcenter Remap to model components, assemblies, or systems, to then determine a model’s behavioral response when subjected to real-world conditions. In addition, Simcenter Remap provides powerful data-driven and graphical results visualization and evaluation, which in combination with the industry-leading Simcenter Nast ran, delivers a comprehensive CAE solution that improves product performance.

                        Femap is CAD independent and leverages Siemens Digital Industries Software’s Para solid® modeling kernel that allows direct access to Para solid data for surface and solid modeling in addition to advanced geometric tools necessary for accessing non-Para solid geometry.
