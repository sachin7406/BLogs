                        RapidAuthor is a robust and adaptable authoring suite that provides organizations with the capability to create all types of support documentation, including interactive parts catalogs, maintenance manuals, training materials, and work instructions.

                        The tools offered by RapidAuthor allow organizations to leverage existing CAD data or other 3D source materials for the creation of interactive 3D publications, thereby minimizing effort and reducing timelines. These tools are user-friendly and intuitive, requiring no prior CAD or 3D experience.

                        Each tool within the Cortona3D RapidAuthor suite is accompanied by the Cortona2D Editor Pro and wizards that streamline significant portions of the authoring process.

                        RapidAuthor is designed as a modular product, enabling you to acquire only the specific components you require while maintaining the flexibility to expand in the future.
