                    Make an engineering impact on Electric Vehicle with the digital twin
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Creating a digital twin of the product and the production can solve the challenges of EV manufacturing by blurring the boundaries between design and manufacturing, merging the physical and digital worlds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Digitalization has become a necessity in order to support the rapid pace of innovation and the complexity in today’s automotive market, including electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A comprehensive digital twin enables you to plan and implement manufacturing processes for new lightweight designs and modular vehicle platforms while reducing the costs of battery production and coordinating across your deep supplier ecosystems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Automobile development is facing multiple challenges arising out of electrification, regulation and evolving customer preferences. OEMs and suppliers have to develop new products in lesser time and at lesser cost. Siemens and DDS enable innovation processes to support rapid development of new products.
